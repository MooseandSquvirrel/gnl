This project was part of an intensive education on learning the fundamentals of computer programming. The course focused on project-based learning that primarily focused on the basics 
of the C language. <br /><br />This particular project was built to begin to understand the concept of the buffer and how it is uzilized in programming. The function must know when it has reached the end of a particular line and then grab the next line of the text it is reading as input. The project therefore also introduced the concept of file descriptors and therefore input/output from a file source, as well as static variables. The static variable is the key to getting the function to work by saving the previously read data to the buffer to check against and keep it's place so that it doesn't lose the memory of the data when a function finishes having been popped of the stack.



### Built With

* [C](https://www.learn-c.org/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* None, other than making sure your machine has GCC/GNU Unix capabilities for running the MakeFile.
  ```sh
  N/A
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MooseandSquvirrel/gnl.git.git
   ```



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

You can use this function as an example of how buffers, file descriptors (input/output), and static variables function. 

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://github.com/MooseandSquvirrel/gnl.git.git)_
